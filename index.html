            <p class="intro">I heard that you're settled down...</p>
            <p class="verse">That you found a girl and you're married now.</p>
            <p class="verse">I heard that your dreams came true.</p>
            <p class="chorus">Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.</p>
            <p class="verse">Old friend, why are you so shy?</p>
            <p class="verse">Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.</p>
            <p class="chorus">I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited...</p>
            <p class="chorus">But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.</p>
            <p class="verse">I had hoped you'd see my face...</p>
            <p class="verse">And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over.</p>
            <p class="chorus">Never mind, I'll find someone like you.</p>
            <p class="chorus">I wish nothing but the best for you too.</p>
            <p class="verse">Don't forget me, I beg.</p>
            <p class="verse">I remember you said:</p>
            <p class="chorus">Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.</p>
